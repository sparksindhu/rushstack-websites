## 3 minute demo

Want to see Rush in action? The only prerequisite you need is [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

**From your shell, install Rush like this:**

```sh
$ npm install -g @microsoft/rush
```

(Don't type the **"$"** of course.) :-)

**Try this if above command didn't work:**

```sh
$ volta run npm install -g @microsoft/rush
```

**For command-line help, do this:**

```sh
$ rush -h
```

**To see Rush build some real projects, try running these commands:**

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/microsoft/rushstack
$ cd rushstack

# Install the NPM packages:
# (If you don't have a GitHub email configured, add the "--bypass-policy" option.)
$ rush update

# Incremental install:
$ rush update  # <-- instantaneous!

# Force all projects to be rebuilt:
$ rush rebuild

# Incremental build:
$ rush build    # <-- instantaneous!

# Use "--verbose" to view the console logs for each project as it is built.
# Projects build in parallel processes, but their logs are collated.
$ rush rebuild --verbose
```
